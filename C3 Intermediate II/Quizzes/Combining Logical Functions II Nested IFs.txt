
Question 1

For the arguments to the IF function, other IF functions may be embedded within them.
Of the 3 arguments to the IF function, which can have another IF nested in them?

First argument: logical_test
Second argument: value_if_true
Third argument: value_if_false


Question 2

To detect whether the cells X1, Y1, and Z1 contain exactly 2 values which are the same (e.g. X1 and Z1 are the same and Y1 is different), the coding for giving an output "Duplicate" could look like:

=IF(X1=Y1,IF(X1=Z1,"","Duplicate"),IF(OR(X1=Z1,Y1=Z1),"Duplicate",""))


Question 3

To detect whether the values in cells X1, Y1, and Z1 are in descending order (with no ties), the coding for giving an output "Descending Order" could look like:

=IF(X1>Y1,IF(Y1>Z1,"Descending Order",""),"")


Question 4

Consider the code =IF(X1>=Y1,"", IF(Y1>=Z1,"","tick")).
Supposing the output "tick" is produced, which of the following could be true about X1, Y1, Z1?
Please note that ties are allowed for this question.

X1, Y1, Z1 are in ascending order.
